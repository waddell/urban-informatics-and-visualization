    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This first session will cover the basics of Python, and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data.  The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook.  It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively, with the results appearing inline.  We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now.  Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook.  Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by getting familiar with the Jupyter Notebook and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launching a Jupyter Notebook on DataHub\n",
    "In this course we will be using hosted computing facilities to make it easy to start learning to code in Python and to leverage university computing infrastructure.  If you have a relatively recent computer you can install all the software yourself, since it is free and open source.  In class we will use datahub, and you can use a Calnet login to connect it at http://datahub.berkeley.edu.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launching a Jupyter Notebook at the Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin using a Jupyter Notebook on your own computer, you need to launch a command prompt (or command shell).  If you don't know what this is, you'll need to get familiar with the command prompt and navigating around on your computer using change directory commands, in order to be able to launch the notebook. The Lab computers have been upgraded to Windows 10.  In this version of Windows, there are multiple ways to open a command prompt - nicely explained here: http://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a mac, you can launch the terminal app.  Once you have a shell, navigate (change directory) to whatever directory you want to work in. If you haven't learned how to use a command prompt in windows, this is a good reference for the command prompt in Windows: http://dosprompt.info/. On a mac, the syntax is a bit different since it is based on Linux.  Here is a reference for commands on the mac: http://ss64.com/osx/, or a simpler version here: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-basic-unix-commands-to-work-in-terminal.html. You'll need to use the command prompt from the beginning, so get comfortable with basic commands this week if you are not already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download this notebook from the link in the calendar event for this session on the class bspace site.  Save it to disk somewhere, like Downloads, or some other location (but just remember where you put it).  At the command prompt, cd to that location, and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you launch the Jupyter Notebook, and the Notebook opens up in your browser, you will be looking at a directory of the folder you were in when you launched the notebook.  you can either load an existing notebook if you see one in the directory, or create a new one.  If you changed directory to the correct location, you should already see this notebook in the directory in the Jupyter Notebook:\n",

    "**Introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks-and-python.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ipynb is a reference to the older name of IPython Notebook for the Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on this entry in the directory within the Jupyter Notebook, another tab will be created in your browser, containing this notebook, ready to use.  Go ahead and do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it has cells, that contain text (until farther down in the notebook).  These are markdown cells.  Notice the pulldown list for the cell type contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code -- which we will use for Python code mainly, though it could use other languages\n",
    "* Markdown, like this cell, using a flavor of structured text like that used in Wikipedia and many other platforms\n",
    "* Other options will appear depending on what else is installed for use with Jupyter, like kernels for Scala, R, Octave, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the contents of a cell by double-clicking on it.  Try it on this cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready to save it or exit edit mode, just use Shift-Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how the code cells work next, in the context of learning a bit about the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on to that, though, just note that you can use Markdown syntax to format your text.  Documentation on the markdown syntax is available here: http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use LaTeX syntax to enter math or create symbols in your Markdown cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\alpha + \\beta X $\n",
    "\n",
    "$c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can also contain programs, or code.  We will be using Python code extensively in this course.  The next cell contains a Python command, and that command can be executed in the Notebook by clicking Shift-Enter on the cell, or selecting Cell/Run Cells from the menu, or clicking on the Run icon  (left of the black square), on the toolbar.  Notice that it executes the command and writes the output below the cell.\n"

    "Python is an interpreted programming language, also referred to as a *high-level language*, or as a scripting language.  What this means is that when you write some commands, or statements that are meaningful in the Python language, the Python 'interpreter' reads the command, figures out what the intended computation is, and then executes it.  This differs from *low-level* languages like C or C++, in which you generally have to compile code  before you can run it, and if you find errors they have to be diagnosed and then the code re-compiled before you can run it.  Interpreted languages skip the compile step, and just execute code directly, and if there are errors, they are seen at run-time.  "

The convention of using **.py** as the suffix for a Python script makes it easy to find and run such scripts and to have the Python interpreter parse the statements and execute them one at a time, from top to bottom, as though they had been entered interactively (there are some minor differences in how the interpreter parses interactive commands as compared to scripts, but we will ignore that for now).\n",

The convention is to use a # sign at the beginning of the line to indicate that that line is a comment, and not to be parsed and executed by Python.
