    "## First, a Review on Planning Your Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most difficult things about learning to program is to learn how to start.  What to do before you write the code, and how to work your way through the coding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good general idea is to think through the problem you want to solve first -- just conceptually.  How will you know you have solved it?  Are there tests that you can use to be sure?  Can you break the problem down into smaller components, and solve those sequentially?  This is a step that is conceptualizing your algorithm, or your plan for the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What approach would you use to solve each of those components? Can you describe those steps in English? We call this step writing 'pseudo-code'\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is the coding step. And the inevitable debugging step.  You really can't do one without the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, it is good practice to work your way through problems in this way, and write the code for each building block, testing it to be sure it works for all the kinds of cases you can imagine, then test them together.  You'll end up being more productive, and far less frustrated, using a systematic, problem-solving approach.  \n",
